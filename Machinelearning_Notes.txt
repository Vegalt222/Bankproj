The reports in 2 ways:
  a)xlsx report====>Excel report having an extension of filename.xlsx==>emp.xlsx
  b)csv report(comma seperated value) report having an extension of filename.csv==>emp.csv.


x=100
df=100
pd=pandas.read_excel()
df=pandas.DataFrame()


if we want to check the data inside of any module. we can use __dir__()

import math
print(math.__dir__())#check how many properties are there.
print(math.factorial(5))#5!===>5*4*3*2*1==>120

print(help(math))#to check how to work with each function with in a module.


help():
======
it is a predefined inbuilt function in python which is used to view the complete description
about every property with in a module.

example:
========
print(help(math))#to check how to work with each function with in a module.

*)pandas:
========
pandas is a one of the predefined module
in python which is used to perform an
dataframe kind of operations.

using pandas we can the prepare the
dataset in the form of tabular format using
rows and columns using dataFrame() in python.

If we want pandas module in python then we can install pandas module in python.
pip install pandas.
